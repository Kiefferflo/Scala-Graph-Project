# Scala Graph Project

## Models of directed and undirected graphs
### Algorithms

#### Undirected
- Kruskal
- Welsh-Powell
- DSATUR

#### Directed
- Topological Order
- Dijkstra

### Implementations

#### Undirected
- Base, set of Vertices and set of Edges
- Neighbors, map of Vertices to a set of Vertices
- Matrix, seq of Vertice with there order in the matrix and matrix of adjacency
#### Directed
- Base, set of Vertices and set of Arcs
- Successors, map of Vertices to a set of Vertices
- Matrix, seq of Vertice in there order in the matrix and matrix of adjacency

## Applications
- Affectations of frequancies (use ressource attennes.csv)
- Reconnexion of antennas (use ressource attennes.csv)
- Makefile order of compilation (use ressource Makefile)
- GPS appilcation (use ressource GPSTest.txt)
